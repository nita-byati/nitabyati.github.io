            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This documentation presents my contributions to our senior capstone group project, where I focused on UX/UI design and marketing strategies. Through this work, I demonstrate my approach to user-centered design, visual communication, and brand development.</p>
            <p>Working alongside my UX/UI partner Warren Goodell, I helped create an intuitive and engaging user experience while developing cohesive marketing materials that effectively communicated our project's value proposition.</p>

            <h3>Team Composition</h3>
            <p>Our project was a collaborative effort between multiple team members with specialized roles:</p>
            <p>• <strong>UX/UI Design:</strong> Nita Byati, Warren Goodell<br>
            • <strong>Marketing:</strong> Nita Byati<br>
            • <strong>Development:</strong> Woong Huh</p>

            <h3>Initial Approach with CU Boulder</h3>
            <p>At first we wanted to work with CU Boulder to have a website that is directly linked to some part of CU's website. We created design systems and wireframes based on CU's. However, with much effort to get in contact with them and work with them, we were unsuccessful. We then decided to scrap our original idea and go rogue—making a design system and website we actually like.</p>

            <h3>UX/UI Design Process</h3>
            <p>Working alongside Warren Goodell, I helped create an intuitive, accessible, and visually engaging user experience for our project.</p>

            <h4>User Research</h4>
            <p>We conducted user interviews and surveys to understand our target audience, creating detailed personas that guided our design decisions. This research revealed key pain points and opportunities that shaped our approach.</p>

            <h4>Information Architecture & Wireframes</h4>
            <p>I developed the site structure and user flows, creating low-fidelity wireframes that established the foundation for our interface design. This involved multiple iterations based on team feedback and user testing.</p>

            <h4>UI Design System</h4>
            <p>I created a comprehensive design system including typography and color palette. This system ensured visual consistency while accommodating accessibility requirements.</p>

            <h4>Prototyping & User Testing</h4>
            <p>I developed interactive prototypes in Figma and conducted usability testing sessions, analyzing feedback to refine the design. This iterative process helped identify and resolve usability issues before development.</p>

            <h3>Marketing Strategy & Materials</h3>
            <p>I developed and implemented marketing strategies to effectively promote our project, creating cohesive brand materials and communication channels.</p>

            <h4>Brand Identity Development</h4>
            <p>I created a distinctive brand identity including logo, color scheme, typography, and "vibe". I was able to start this with marketing research. I did research on which students do the most physical projects and what major and building they are in.</p>

            <h4>Posters & Promotional Materials</h4>
            <p>I designed promotional materials including posters. These posters effectively communicated our project's value proposition and core features. I placed them on campus, in the places where students do the most projects.</p>

            <h4>Social Media Strategy</h4>
            <p>I posted on my social media (as I have many environmental enthusiasts and engineering people following me) about our website, leveraging my existing audience to promote the project.</p>

            <h3>Final Deliverables</h3>
            <p>• Comprehensive design system and brand guidelines<br>
            • Interactive prototypes and wireframes<br>
            • Marketing materials and promotional posters<br>
            • Social media campaign strategy<br>
            • Explainer video animation created in After Effects</p>

            <h3>Project Outcomes</h3>
            <p>This project demonstrated my ability to work collaboratively in a team environment, conduct comprehensive user research, develop cohesive design systems, and create effective marketing strategies. The experience reinforced my passion for creating user-centered solutions that address real-world problems.</p>
